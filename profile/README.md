## Why retinify?
retinify is an advanced AI-powered stereo vision library for robotics that delivers real-time, high-precision 3D perception by offloading compute-intensive tasks to GPU servers.
- üî• **High Precision**: Real-time, accurate 3D mapping and object recognition using stereo camera input.
- üí∞ **Cost Efficiency**: Relies solely on cameras‚Äîno expensive LiDAR or other specialized sensors‚Äîsignificantly lowering hardware costs.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Scalability**: Efficiently manages multiple robots from a single server, reducing the need for high-end onboard computing.
